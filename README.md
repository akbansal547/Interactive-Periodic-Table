# Interactive Periodic Table

## Overview

This is a simple yet interactive version of the periodic table made using just HTML and CSS. It shows all 118 elements arranged like in the real periodic table, and you can click on each one to get more info. There’s also a search bar and filters that lets you find elements by their name, symbol or even category like Metals or Noble Gasses. It’s designed to be clean and easy to use especially for students or anyone curious about chemistry.
